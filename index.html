<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p class="fragment">Let's say we start with two points, a ruler, and a compass. I.e. we can draw lines between any two points, and we can draw a circle around a point through a point.</p>
<p class="fragment">What shapes can we make? </p>
</section>
<section >
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Let's say we are given the two red points.
Just by playing around it is fairly easy to make a triangle.</p>
<img src="images/ConstructingTriangle.png" width="43%">
<!-- ![Triangle](images/ConstructingTriangle.png) -->
</section>
<section >
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>It is also not too hard to construct a square. Let's say we are given <span class="math">\(P_0\)</span> and <span class="math">\(P_1\)</span>. <br>
We first construct the point <span class="math">\(P_2\)</span> with the green circle. <br>
Then we draw the two blue circles, and the line between their intersections (<span class="math">\(Q_1\)</span> and <span class="math">\(Q_2\)</span>) is the <span class="math">\(y\)</span>-axis.
<p class="fragment">In particular this can be used to construct the perpendicular bisector.</p></p>
<img src="images/ConstructingSquare.png" width="43%">
</section>
<section >
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>The hexagon is slightly harder. We are again starting with <span class="math">\(P_0\)</span> and <span class="math">\(P_1\)</span> <br>
We start with the green circle, and then draw a blue circle with midpoint <span class="math">\(P_1\)</span> through <span class="math">\(P_0\)</span>. <br>
This circle intersects the green one, and we draw a new circle around this intersection through the previous midpoint. <br>
By keeping going like this we will eventually get all 6 corners.</p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>The pentagon is the first harder shape to find. <br>
And if you find it through playing around, can you be <em>sure</em> that it is actually a pentagon? <br>
How would you even proof that?
<p class="fragment">By the end of this, I hope to show you how thinking algebraically about a geometric problem can help answer questions like this. <br>
I will assume that you have a very basic familiarity with complex numbers, but nothing more. <br>
This presentation is 2-dimensional. If a slide contains harder material I tried to make it more clear on the slides underneath it. <br>
You can press down with the arrow keys or on the arrows on the bottom right corner. <br>
Please try it out :)</p></p>

<h3>Helper slide</h3>
<p>Well done! Slides like this, that are <em>underneath</em> another slide contain more details or explanations. If something is unclear I hope this helps.</p>

<h3>A Deal with the Devil</h3>
<p>One of my favorite math quotes is my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Atiyah">Michael Atiyah</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Algebra is the offer made by the devil to the mathematician. The devil says: "I will give you this powerful machine, it will answer any question you like. All you need to do is give me your soul: give up geometry and you will have this marvellous machine."</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="fragment">So today I will show you the power of the deal.</p>
</section>
<section >
<section >
<h3>Basic Arithmetic</h3>
<p>First of all we need to understand that the set of points we can construct form an algebraic structure. <br>
We think of the plane as the complex numbers and I claim that if we have constructed any two points, then we can add and multiply them as complex numbers. (To be more precise it is a <em>subfield</em>)<br>
To show this, it is enough to prove it for real numbers, i.e. points on the <span class="math">\(x\)</span>-axis. This will make the pictures with the constructions less 'crowded' with shapes. (For more details on why this works click down.)</p>
<p class="fragment">For arithmetic to even make sense we need to fix a frame of reference. We have seen from the construction of the square that we can draw a the coordinate axis. See the second helper slide for a more details.</p>
</section>
<section >
<h3>Some Quick Notes on Complex Numbers</h3>
<p>Real numbers (denoted <span class="math">\(\mathbb{R}\)</span>) are numbers as most people would understand them in everyday life. They can be positive or negative, whole numbers like <span class="math">\(1,2,-7\)</span>, fractions like <span class="math">\(\frac{1}{2}\)</span> or more complicated things like <span class="math">\(\sqrt{2}\)</span> or <span class="math">\(\pi\)</span>.</p>
<p>A complex number <span class="math">\(z\)</span> consists of two parts, a real and imaginary part. You can think of the real part as the <span class="math">\(x\)</span>-direction and of the imaginary part as the <span class="math">\(y\)</span>-direction. That is why we can identify points on a plane with complex numbers.</p>
<p>Because we can easily 'rotate' every number by 90° (see for example how we constructed <span class="math">\(Q_1\)</span> and <span class="math">\(Q_2\)</span> for the square), we can construct the complex number <span class="math">\(a + bi\)</span> from the two real numbers <span class="math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math">\(b\)</span> with ruler and compass. And therefore it is enough to only consider basic arithmetic on the real number line.</p>
<p>This construction can also be seen on the next slide.</p>
</section>
<section >
<h3>Fixing a Frame of Reference</h3>
<p>Remember: We always start with two points. We can just declare one of them to be <em>defined</em> as the origin, i.e. <span class="math">\((0,0)\)</span> and the other one as <span class="math">\((0,1)\)</span>, and implicit in this is
<em> the definition of the <span class="math">\(x\)</span>-axis.
</em> the definition of <span class="math">\(1\)</span>.
In the picture above this is indicated by the black lines.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section >
<section >
<h3>Addition</h3>
<p>Let's say, from the two points we started with, we have constructed two additional arbitrary real numbers <span class="math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math">\(b\)</span>.</p>
<p>We can add them in the following way:</p>
<ul>
<li>First rotate <span class="math">\(b\)</span> up to the <span class="math">\(y\)</span>-axis by drawing the circle.</li>
<li>Draw a perpendicular line to the <span class="math">\(y\)</span>-axis through <span class="math">\(bi\)</span>.</li>
<li>Draw a perpendicular line to the <span class="math">\(x\)</span>-axis through <span class="math">\(a\)</span>.</li>
<li>Where the two lines meet is the point <span class="math">\(a+bi\)</span>.</li>
<li>Drawing the circle around <span class="math">\(a\)</span> through <span class="math">\(a+bi\)</span> gives us <span class="math">\(a+b\)</span> as one of the intersections with the <span class="math">\(x\)</span>-axis.</li>
</ul>
<img src="images/Arithmetic_Addition.png" width="39%">
</section>
<section >
<h3>Drawing Perpendicular Lines through a Point on a Line</h3>
<ul>
<li>Draw an arbitrary circle around the point.</li>
<li>Draw the perpendicular bisector of the two points where the circle intersects the line (see the square construction on how to do this).</li>
</ul>
</section>
</section>
<section >
<section >
<h3>Multiplication</h3>
<p>This time we start with <span class="math">\(b\)</span> already on the <span class="math">\(y\)</span>-axis. To construct the product of two arbitary real numbers <span class="math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math">\(b\)</span> we:</p>
<ul>
<li>Draw the line between the points <span class="math">\((0,1)\)</span> (or <span class="math">\(i\)</span> in the complex numbers) and <span class="math">\((a,0)\)</span>.</li>
<li>We draw the parallel line through <span class="math">\((0,b)\)</span> (or <span class="math">\(bi\)</span> in the complex numbers).</li>
<li>The point where it crosses the <span class="math">\(x\)</span>-axis is the point <span class="math">\((a\cdot b, 0)\)</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Try to <em>prove</em> that this is the case. A solution is on the helper slides.</p>
<img src="images/Arithmetic_Multiplication.png" width="43%" >
</section>
<section >
<h3>Constructing the Parallel Line through a Point</h3>
<ul>
<li>Draw an arbitrary circle around the point, that is big enough to intersect the line twice.</li>
<li>Draw the perpendicular bisector through these two new points. It will go through the original point.</li>
<li>Draw the perpendicular line through the point, on the bisector we just constructed.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section >
<h3>Proof that the Constructed Point is actually the Product</h3>
<p>The line between <span class="math">\((0,1)\)</span> and <span class="math">\((a,0)\)</span> satisfies the equation <span class="math">\(y=-\frac{1}{a}x + 1\)</span>. To see this noe that we are going <span class="math">\(a\)</span> units to the left and one unit down. That is where the <span class="math">\(-\frac{1}{a}\)</span> comes from. The <span class="math">\(+1\)</span> is because it intersects the <span class="math">\(y\)</span>-axis in <span class="math">\(1\)</span>.</p>
<p>Now the parallel line has the same slope so its equation is <span class="math">\(y=-\frac1a x + b\)</span>. Solving this for zero gives
<span class="math">\[\begin{align*}
-\frac{1}{a} x + b &amp;\overset{!}{=} 0\\
\frac{1}{a} x &amp;= b\\
x &amp;= ab
\end{align*}\]</span></p>
</section>
</section>
<section >
<section >
<h3>Inverses</h3>
<p>With everything we have done so far, you might want to try to figure out how to construct <span class="math">\(-a\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\frac{1}{a}\)</span> from <span class="math">\(a\)</span>.</p>
<p>Here are two hints:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math">\(-a\)</span> can be defined as the number such that <span class="math">\(0\)</span> is the midpoint between it and <span class="math">\(a\)</span>.</li>
<li><span class="math">\(\frac{1}{a}\)</span> is the number that gives <span class="math">\(1\)</span> when multiplied by <span class="math">\(a\)</span>. So on the previous slide try to go backwards by assuming <span class="math">\(ab=1\)</span> and then finding <span class="math">\(b\)</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Solutions are on the helper slides</p>
</section>
<section >
<h3>Additive Inverse</h3>
<p>If <span class="math">\(a=0\)</span> then we are done. Assume <span class="math">\(a\neq 0\)</span>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Draw a circle around <span class="math">\(0\)</span> through <span class="math">\(a\)</span>.</li>
<li>It intersects the <span class="math">\(x\)</span>-axis exactly twice. Once in <span class="math">\(a\)</span> and once in <span class="math">\(-a\)</span>.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section >
<h3>Multiplicative Inverse</h3>
<p>If <span class="math">\(a=1\)</span> we are done. Assume <span class="math">\(a\neq 1\)</span> and of course <span class="math">\(a\neq 0\)</span>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Draw the line between <span class="math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math">\(i\)</span> as in the construction for multiplication.</li>
<li>Construct the parallel line that goes through <span class="math">\(1\)</span> <em>on the <span class="math">\(x\)</span>-axis</em>.</li>
<li>This line will intersect the <span class="math">\(y\)</span>-axis in <span class="math">\(\frac{1}{a}i\)</span>. By rotating by 90° clockwise we get the desired point.</li>
</ul>
<p>To prove that this works consider: <br>
The first line satisfies <span class="math">\(y=-\frac{1}{a}x + 1\)</span>. The new one has the same slope but an unkown intersection with the <span class="math">\(y\)</span>-axis, let's call it <span class="math">\(b\)</span>. So the equation is <span class="math">\(y = -\frac{1}{a}x + b\)</span>. We know that at <span class="math">\(x=1\)</span> the <span class="math">\(y\)</span>-value is <span class="math">\(0\)</span>, so <span class="math">\(-\frac{1}{a}\cdot 1 + b = 0\)</span>. The result follows.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section >
<h3>Square Root</h3>
<p>We take the square root of some positive number <span class="math">\(a\)</span>. We first draw a circle through the midpoint between <span class="math">\(0\)</span> and <span class="math">\(1+a\)</span> through the origin and <span class="math">\(1+a\)</span>. With this circle</p>
<ul>
<li>We first draw the perpendicular line in <span class="math">\(a\)</span> on the <span class="math">\(x\)</span>-axis. This line intersect the circle.</li>
<li>We draw the triangle with this new point on the circle, the origin, and <span class="math">\(1+a\)</span>.</li>
<li>By <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thales%27s_theorem">Thale's Theorem</a> this is a right triangle, so the following equations all hold</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="math">\[(1+a)^2 = p^2 + q^2;\quad p^2 = 1^2 + h^2;\quad q^2 = a^2 + h^2\]</span>
Together they show <span class="math">\(h^2 = a\)</span>, so the length <span class="math">\(h\)</span> is the desired square root of <span class="math">\(a\)</span>.</p>
<img src="images/Arithmetic_Root.png" width="43%" >
</section>
<section >
<h3>Looking Back</h3>
<p>It might not seem like much and none of the constructions was super long or hard. However, these constructions are the bridge between the algebraic to the geometric world.</p>
<p>From now on, whenever we find a 'recipe' for a number that only involves addition and subtraciton, multiplication and division, and taking square roots, we can also construct it geometrically. <em>And not only for the real numbers but the complex numbers as well.</em></p>
<p><em>This is the key for getting deeper understanding of geometric constructions</em>.</p>
</section>
<section >
<h3>Attacking the Pentagon</h3>
<p>We are finally at the point where we can reformulate the problem of finding a pentagon in an algebraic way.</p>
<p>Let's say we want one corner of the pentagon to be the complex number <span class="math">\(1\)</span>, and all the verteces should be on the unit circle. This means we have to find a complex number <span class="math">\(\zeta\)</span> on the unit circle whose angle is <span class="math">\(\frac{360°}{5}\)</span>.</p>
<img src="images/RawPentagon_1.png" width="43%" >
</section>
<section >
<section >
<h3>Attacking the Pentagon</h3>
<p>Remember: Multiplying two complex numbers means adding their angles and multiplying their lengths. But <span class="math">\(\zeta\)</span> has length <span class="math">\(1\)</span> since it is on the unit circle, so we just add the angles.</p>
<p>Arithmetically that means the verteces of the pentagon we try to construct are <span class="math">\(1,\zeta,\zeta^2,\zeta^3,\zeta^4\)</span>.</p>
<img src="images/RawPentagon_2.png" width="43%" >
</section>
<section >
<h3>Why does Multiplication Correspond to Adding Angles?</h3>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number#Cartesian_complex_plane">Complex numbers can be written</a>, as <span class="math">\(r(\cos(\alpha) + i\sin(\alpha))\)</span> for an angle <span class="math">\(\alpha\)</span> and a length <span class="math">\(r\)</span>. We assume <span class="math">\(r=1\)</span>. Now if you have two numbers with two angles, <span class="math">\(\alpha\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\beta\)</span>, you get</p>
<p><span class="math">\[(\cos(\alpha) + i\sin(\alpha))\cdot(\cos(\beta) + i\sin(\beta)) = \cos(\alpha)\cos(\beta) - \sin(\alpha) \sin(\beta) + i(\cos(\alpha)\sin(\beta) + \sin(\alpha) \cos(\beta))\]</span></p>
<p>Now you can check <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_trigonometric_identities#Angle_sum_and_difference_identities">Wikipedia</a> to convince yourself that</p>
<p><span class="math">\[\begin{align*}
\cos(\alpha)\cos(\beta) - \sin(\alpha) \sin(\beta) &amp;= \cos(\alpha + \beta) \text{ and }\\
\cos(\alpha)\sin(\beta) + \sin(\alpha) \cos(\beta) &amp;= \sin(\alpha + \beta)
\end{align*}\]</span></p>
<p>Therefore multiplying the complex numbers on the unit circle with angles <span class="math">\(\alpha\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\beta\)</span> gives the number with angle <span class="math">\(\alpha + \beta\)</span></p>
</section>
</section>
<section >
<h3>Adding more Algebra</h3>
<p>We know what we want <em>geometrically</em>. Now we need to find an algebraic 'recipe' consisting of basic arithmetic operations and taking the square root, to construct <span class="math">\(\zeta\)</span>.</p>
<p>So we ask ourselves what <em>algebraic</em> properties does <span class="math">\(\zeta\)</span> have? From the picture, I hope it is clear that <span class="math">\(\zeta^5 = 1\)</span>, since adding another rotation to <span class="math">\(\zeta^4\)</span> is gonna bring us to <span class="math">\(1\)</span>.</p>
<p>That means that <span class="math">\(\zeta\)</span> is the (or better <em>a</em>) root of the polynomial <span class="math">\(P(X) = X^5-1\)</span>.</p>
<img src="images/RawPentagon_2.png" width="43%" >
</section>
<section >
<section >
<h3>Studying <span class="math">\(X^5 - 1 = 0\)</span></h3>
<p>The equation <span class="math">\(X^5 - 1 = 0\)</span> has one easy solution, namely <span class="math">\(1\)</span>. Another one is <span class="math">\(\zeta\)</span>, that's how we stumbled upon this equation in the first place.</p>
<p>In fact the other solutions are the powers of <span class="math">\(\zeta\)</span>, since <span class="math">\((\zeta^k)^5 = \zeta^{5k} = (\zeta^5)^k = 1^k = 1\)</span>. So constructing a pentagon is the same as constructing the solutions of this equation.</p>
<p>But we are starting with <span class="math">\(1\)</span> already given, so in a sense it is already constructed. Can we find a equation that encodes only the <span class="math">\(4\)</span> remaining points? In fact with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial_long_division">Polynomial Division</a> we can. The result is <span class="math">\(X^4+X^3+X^2+X+1\)</span>.</p>
</section>
<section >
<h3>Polynomial Division</h3>
<p>For a more thorough treatment see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial_long_division">Wikipedia</a>. I will only give a short version here.</p>
<p>One can show that if <span class="math">\(P(X)\)</span> and <span class="math">\(Q(X)\)</span> are polynomials, then <span class="math">\(P(X)=Q(X)\cdot A(X) + R(X)\)</span> for some polynomials <span class="math">\(A(X)\)</span> and <span class="math">\(R(X)\)</span>, where <span class="math">\(R(X)\)</span> has lower degree than <span class="math">\(Q\)</span>. If <span class="math">\(Q(X) = (X-x_0)\)</span> for a root of <span class="math">\(P\)</span>, then <span class="math">\(P(x_0)=0\)</span> and <span class="math">\(Q(x_0)=0\)</span>. It follows that <span class="math">\(R(x_0)=0\)</span>. But since <span class="math">\(Q(X)\)</span> has degree one, and the degree of <span class="math">\(R(X)\)</span> is <em>lower</em> it must be a constant. So putting that all together it is <span class="math">\(R(X) = 0\)</span> a constant polynomial.</p>
<p>That is how I knew to divide <span class="math">\(X^5-1\)</span> by <span class="math">\((X-1)\)</span>.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section >
<h3>This is so important it gets its own slide</h3>
<p>The fact that <span class="math">\(\zeta\)</span> is a root of <span class="math">\(X^4 + X^3 + X^2 + X + 1\)</span> means
<span class="math">\[\zeta^4 + \zeta^3 + \zeta^2 + \zeta + 1 = 0\]</span>
<strong>This is the central algebraic ingredient!</strong></p>
</section>
<section >
<section >
<h3>The Big Picture Idea</h3>
<p>We got from a geometric picture to an algebraic equation. Now we will play around with the equations, and that will help us find which circles and lines we need to draw. The way to translate algebra into geometry will be through the basic circle and line equations. In general they are
<span class="math">\[\begin{align*}
(X-x_0)^2 &amp;+ (Y - y_0)^2 = r^2\\
aX &amp;+ bY = c
\end{align*}\]</span>
for a circle or a line, respectively.</p>
<p>So we will aim to find equations that have these forms, and then we know what circle or line they correspond to.</p>
</section>
<section >
<h3>Wait, that line equations seems weird?!</h3>
<p>Many people probably know the equation of a line as <span class="math">\(y=mx + b\)</span>. However this cannot describe lines that are parallel to the <span class="math">\(y\)</span>-axis.</p>
<p>The equation I gave above can describe every line, but the drawback is, that not every line can be <em>uniquely</em> described this way, and also at most one of <span class="math">\(a\)</span> or <span class="math">\(b\)</span> can be zero.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section >
<h3>A Geometric Intermediate Step</h3>
<p>As often in mathematics it makes sense to look for an intermediate step from which the desired result follows more easily.</p>
<p>Here, for example, we would be done if we constructed either the real or imaginary part. Because then we can just draw an orthogonal line through that point, and it will intersect the circle exactly where we want it.</p>
<img src="images/Pentagon_Real_Imag.png" width="43%" >
</section>
<section >
<section >
<h3>A geometric intermediate step</h3>
<p>Here I chose to construct the real part. But the same methods could be used to go for the imaginary part.</p>
<p>The real part of <span class="math">\(\zeta\)</span> is <span class="math">\(\frac{\zeta + \overline{\zeta}}{2} = \frac{\zeta + \zeta^4}{2}\)</span>. However the <span class="math">\(2\)</span> in the denominator will be a bit annoying. Therefore I will construct <span class="math">\(\zeta+\zeta^4\)</span>, and we know from the beginning that we can divide by <span class="math">\(2\)</span>.</p>
<p>Since we know what the algebraic <em>definition</em> of <span class="math">\(\zeta\)</span> is we can use that to find it for <span class="math">\(\zeta + \zeta^4\)</span></p>
</section>
<section >
<h3>Why is <span class="math">\(\overline{\zeta} = \zeta^4\)</span>?</h3>
<p>One argument is simply geometric: The complex conjugate of a number is it's mirror image along the <span class="math">\(x\)</span>-axis.</p>
<p>However it is also <span class="math">\(z\cdot \overline{z} = \lvert z \rvert\)</span>. But for <span class="math">\(\zeta\)</span> the length is <span class="math">\(1\)</span>, and so we already know such a number, namely <span class="math">\(\zeta^4\)</span>.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section >
<h3>Algebraic Equation for the Intermediate Step</h3>
<p>A circle has an equation of degree <span class="math">\(2\)</span>, so we should try to find a quadratic equation for <span class="math">\(\zeta + \zeta^4\)</span>, i.e. we need numbers <span class="math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math">\(b\)</span>, such that <span class="math">\(X^2 + aX + b\)</span> has <span class="math">\(\zeta +\zeta^4\)</span> as a root. Let's plug it in</p>
<p><span class="math">\[\begin{align*}
(\zeta + \zeta^4)^2 + a(\zeta + \zeta^4) + b &amp;\overset{!}{=} 0\\
\zeta^2 + 2\underbrace{\zeta^5}_{=1} + \underbrace{\zeta^8}_{=\zeta^3} + a\zeta + a\zeta^4 + b &amp;= 0
\end{align*}\]</span></p>
<p>We have each power of <span class="math">\(\zeta\)</span> once, and from <span class="math">\(\zeta^4+ \zeta^3 + \zeta^2 + \zeta + 1 = 0\)</span> we find <span class="math">\(a=1\)</span> and <span class="math">\(b=-1\)</span>.</p>
<p>So <span class="math">\(\zeta + \zeta^4\)</span> satisfies the equation <span class="math">\(X^2 + X - 1 = 0\)</span>.</p>

<h3>Finding a Circle for <span class="math">\(\zeta + \zeta^4\)</span></h3>
<p>We need to find a circle that intersects the <span class="math">\(x\)</span>-axis in <span class="math">\(\zeta + \zeta^4\)</span>. The equation of the <span class="math">\(x\)</span>-axis is simply <span class="math">\(Y=0\)</span>. The general equation for a circle is <span class="math">\((X-x_0)^2 + (Y - y_0)^2 = r^2\)</span>. So the intersection is
<span class="math">\[X^2 -2Xx_0 + x_0^2 + y_0^2 = r^2.\]</span>
We want to transform this into <span class="math">\(X^2 + X - 1 = 0\)</span>, so
<span class="math">\[\begin{align*}
-2x_0 &amp;= 1 \left(\Rightarrow x_0 = -\frac12 \right)\\
x_0^2 + y_0^2 -r^2 &amp;= -1 \left(\Rightarrow y_0^2 - r^2 = -\frac54 \right)
\end{align*}\]</span></p>
<p>One possible solution is <span class="math">\(y_0 = 1\)</span> and <span class="math">\(r=3/2\)</span>. The helper slide has some details.</p>
</section>
<section >
<h3>How to <span class="math">\(y_0\)</span> and <span class="math">\(r\)</span>.</h3>
<p>First of all, these aren't the only solutions. But we want rational solutions, since we know from the arithmetic part before, that we can construct all rational numbers.</p>
<p>Next we need <span class="math">\(r&gt;0\)</span> since otherwise it wouldn't be a geometric circle.</p>
<p>As far as actual algebra goes, I would just suggest multiplying with <span class="math">\(4\)</span>, noticing that <span class="math">\(4=2^2\)</span> and then get
<span class="math">\[(2y_0)^2 - (2r)^2 = -5\]</span>
So wee need two square numbers that differ by <span class="math">\(5\)</span>, and <span class="math">\((4,9)\)</span> can be easily found by hand, and then transformed to the solution on the slide above.</p>

<h3>Putting it back into Geometry</h3>
<p>What we have shown, in essance, is that the intersection of the circle
<span class="math">\[\left(X+\frac12\right)^2 + \left(Y-1\right)^2 = \left(\frac32\right)^2 \text{ and the line } Y=0\]</span>
is given by <span class="math">\(X^2+X-1=0\)</span>. <em>So this is a geometric construction of <span class="math">\(\zeta + \zeta^4\)</span></em>.</p>
<p>And we know from the arithmetic part above how to get the midpoint <span class="math">\((-1/2, 1)\)</span> and the radius <span class="math">\(3/2\)</span> of the circle, from two given points.</p>
<p>Then we just take the perpendicular bisector of <span class="math">\(0\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\zeta + \zeta^4\)</span> and the corresponding line will intersect the unit circle in <span class="math">\(\zeta\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\zeta^4\)</span>.</p>

<h3>Putting it all together</h3>
<ul>
<li>Start with two points, define one as the origin <span class="math">\(0\)</span>, the other as <span class="math">\(1\)</span>.</li>
<li>Draw a circle around <span class="math">\(0\)</span> through <span class="math">\(1\)</span>.</li>
<li>Find the points <span class="math">\(M = (-0.5,1)\)</span> and <span class="math">\(R = (-0.5,-0.5)\)</span> (not shown here).</li>
<li>Draw a circle around <span class="math">\(M\)</span> through <span class="math">\(R\)</span>.</li>
<li>The circle intersects the <span class="math">\(x\)</span>-axis in <span class="math">\(\zeta + \zeta^4\)</span>.</li>
<li>Draw the perpendicular bisector of <span class="math">\(0\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\zeta + \zeta^4\)</span>, giving us <span class="math">\(\zeta\)</span></li>
<li>Compute the powers of <span class="math">\(\zeta\)</span>.</li>
